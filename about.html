                 <p>We are going to tell you a little bit about us. My name is Marat, and I am a father. This project was created as a last chance to interested my son Roma in learning the languages. He has been learning English for about four years, and he is still struggling to speak. I have spent much money on different types of school and recently have decided to teach him myself through podcasting together. I have been learning English for about six years and Spanish for about a year. I have used a lot of different resources, and in my opinion, I have some tips which will help you in a learning journey.</p>
                 <p>My name is Roma, and I am the reason why we are making this podcast. I find the learning languages at school boring and ineffective, so we decided to learn it via doing this project. I think that learning languages are essential for my future life. My dream is to become a programmist, and for this profession, it is vital to know English well enough. Another reason why I am learning languages is travelling. It is my dream to visit all countries on our Earth.
